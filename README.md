# Clutering_z
Different codes I used to run clustering redshifts calibration.
I try to make them as understandable as possible.

Auto-corr can be used to evaluate the auto-correlations, and so galaxy biases

Cross-corr can be used to evaluate cross-correlations between a reference (binned in redshift) and an unknown sample.

w_dm_Cz is the code to compute the theoretical 2pt matter correlation function (DES and Euclid), add some clustering/magnifications  matrices (DESY6)
