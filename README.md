# Clustering_z
Different codes I used to run clustering redshifts calibration.
I try to make them as user-friendly as possible. Please contact me if you have any question and/or suggestion! You can also contact me to talk about your redshift calibration ideas and projects :) 

- Auto-corr can be used to evaluate the auto-correlations, and so galaxy biases

- Cross-corr can be used to evaluate cross-correlations between a reference (binned in redshift) and an unknown sample.

- w_dm_Cz is the code to compute the theoretical 2pt matter correlation function (DES and Euclid), and some clustering/magnifications  matrices (DESY6)
